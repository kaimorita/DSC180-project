1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter? 

The most interesting topic we covered was the change of the climate between now and the year 2100. Some examples are that precipitation near the equator will move north, and that some of the North Atlantic will get colder as climate change progresses due to many factors. Creating models is interesting, but also understanding why the models predict what they do it just as interesting.

2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.

One potential investigation is using bootstrapping to train the model data. Since the training dataset is small, a technique such as bootstrapping could be helpful to the amount of training data and thus model performance. However, since the dataset has many dimensions, including temporal and spatial dimensions, I'm not sure how feasible this approach could be.

3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?

One potential change I would make to the approach in my current Quarter 1 project is including/removing some of the idealized climate simulations. The idealized climate simulations are scenarios in which greenhouse gas emissions increase unrealistically, such as a sudden quadrupling of CO2 or a 1% annual increase in CO2. Since these simulations provide insight on climate modeling but do not necessarily reflect our future, I would like to see how the presence or absence of the simulations affect model performance and interpretability.

4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?

Some other techniques I would be interested is refining/trying out different models. The linear model performed very well and it easy to train/implement, so I think that could be a potential avenue of exploration. Also, models such as XGBoost could work well and could potentially improve upon the random forest model presented in the paper.
